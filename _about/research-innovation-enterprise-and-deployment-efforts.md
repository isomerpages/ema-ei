Climate change is a global existential threat and Singapore is committed to do our part to peak emissions by 2030 and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by or around mid- century. 

The power sector plays a key part as it contributes about 40% of Singapore’s carbon emissions. To achieve our vision of a sustainable energy future, EMA has announced the Singapore Energy Transition in 2021 to decarbonise the power sector and to ensure that the power system remains secure, reliable, and sustainable. The plan is guided by the four Switches – natural gas, solar, regional power grids, and low-carbon alternatives to transform Singapore’s energy supply while promoting energy efficiency to reduce demand. 

Advancing Singapore’s energy transition requires a collective effort. EMA has been partnering industry players, Institutes of Higher Learning and Research Institutes to build sustainable energy solutions and capabilities. This is to meet Singapore’s national and economic needs and to support the growth of local energy enterprises. More than S$100M of grants have been awarded to industry and the research community to:

* **Catalyse Research & Innovation**: To enable the integration of more clean energy into our power system, help reduce energy demand and strengthen grid resilience in support of the Singapore Energy Transition.

* **Support Enterprise Development**: To strengthen the translation of ideas into new market opportunities and nurture a vibrant energy ecosystem.

* **Facilitate Deployment of Promising Solutions**: To address industry-relevant challenges, and help our local enterprises build track records and enhance international competitiveness through strategic partnerships.
