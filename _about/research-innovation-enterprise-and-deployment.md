The Singapore Green Plan 2030 was launched as a whole-of-nation movement to tackle climate change and accelerate Singapore’s effort towards our long-term net zero emissions aspiration.

Today, the power sector contributes about 40% of emissions in Singapore. To achieve our vision of a clean and efficient energy future, we need to change the way we use and produce energy, especially if energy demand continues to rise with economic growth.

EMA has been partnering industry players, Institutes of Higher Learning and Research Institutes to build sustainable energy solutions and capabilities. This is to meet Singapore’s national and economic needs and to support the growth of local energy enterprises. More than S$100M of grants have been awarded to industry and the research community to: 

* **Catalyse Research & Innovation**: To enable the integration of more clean energy into our power system, help reduce energy demand and strengthen grid resilience in support of Singapore Green Plan 2030.

* **Support Enterprise Development**: To strengthen the translation of ideas into new market opportunities and nurture a vibrant energy ecosystem.

* **Facilitate Deployment of Promising Solutions**: To address industry-relevant challenges, and help our local enterprises build track records and enhance international competitiveness through strategic partnerships.
